## It's important

Library was created for my personal purposes, so it may contain some bugs and strange code :)

## Installation

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Only manual

## Getting started

#### Creating an API

```python
>>> from wglib import api

>>> wot  = api.WoT("application_id", "region")  # World of Tanks API
>>> wotb = api.WoTB("application_id", "region")  # World of Tanks Blitz API
>>> wotx = api.WoTX("application_id", "platform")  # World of Tanks Console API
>>> wows = api.WoWS("application_id", "region")  # World of Warships API
>>> wowp = api.WoWS("application_id", "region")  # World of Warplanes API
>>> wgn  = api.WGN("application_id", "region")  # Wargaming Network API
```

Available regions can be found in the [Wargaming PAPI documentation](https://developers.wargaming.net/documentation/).
Available platforms at the moment are `xbox` and `ps4`.

You can also specify a default language for API:

```python
>>> wot = api.WoT("demo", "ru", language="en")  # World of Tanks API
```

And use async API:

```python
>>> from wglib.aio import api

>>> aiowgn = api.WGN("application_id", "region")  # Wargaming Network API
```

#### Creating a request

Available request methods can be found in the [Wargaming PAPI reference](https://developers.wargaming.net/reference/).

```python
"""
Game servers info
https://developers.wargaming.net/reference/all/wgn/servers/info/
"""

>>> res = wgn.servers.info(game="wot")
<wglib.api.base.Response object>

>>> res = await aiowgn.servers.info(game="wot")  # async/await syntax
<wglib.api.base.Response object>
```

Response object contains raw (json) data in the `res.raw` and parsed data in the `res.data`.

```python
>>> res.data
{'status': 'ok', 'data': {'wot': [{'server': 'RU1', 'players_online': 47845} ...

>>> res.data["status"]
'ok'
>>> res["status"]  # dict-like
'ok'
```
